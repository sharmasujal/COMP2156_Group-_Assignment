George Brown College, located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is named after George Brown, one of the Fathers of Confederation in Canada. However, he is not the founder of the college itself. George Brown College was established in 1967 through the amalgamation of several institutions, including the Toronto Free School of Art, the Ontario College of Pharmacy, and the Provincial Institute of Textiles. Therefore, while George Brown's name is associated with the college, he is not its literal founder.

One such example is chef Susur Lee, a renowned Canadian chef known for his innovative culinary creations and appearances on cooking shows. Another notable alum is Jean-Marc Vall√©e, an acclaimed Canadian filmmaker known for directing films such as "Dallas Buyers Club" and "Wild," as well as the HBO series "Big Little Lies." These are just a couple of examples, but George Brown College has produced many successful individuals across different industries.
