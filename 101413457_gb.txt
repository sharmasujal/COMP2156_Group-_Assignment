George Brown College, located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is named after George Brown, one of the Fathers of Confederation in Canada. However, he is not the founder of the college itself. George Brown College was established in 1967 through the amalgamation of several institutions, including the Toronto Free School of Art, the Ontario College of Pharmacy, and the Provincial Institute of Textiles. Therefore, while George Brown's name is associated with the college, he is not its literal founder.
