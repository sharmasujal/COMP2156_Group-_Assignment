# Information about Devops

# DevOps can be best explained as people working together to conceive, build and deliver secure software at top speed. 

#  DevOps engineers are instrumental in combining code, application maintenance, and application management. 

#  All of these tasks rely on understanding not only development life cycles, but DevOps culture, and its philosophy, practices, and tools.
